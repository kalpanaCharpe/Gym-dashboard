- **Members** - Add, edit, delete members
- **Trainers** - Add, edit, delete trainers
- **Classes** - Add, edit, delete classes
- **Attendance** - Track check-ins and check-outs
- **Payments** - Record and manage payments

Data changes are stored in localStorage to persist between sessions during development.

## 🎨 Customization

### Theme Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize the color scheme:

```javascript
colors: {
  primary: {
    500: '#ef4444', // Main brand color
    600: '#dc2626',
    // ... other shades
  }
}
```

### Dark Mode
Toggle dark mode using the moon/sun icon in the header. Preference is saved to localStorage.

### Components
All components are in `src/components/` and are fully customizable. Each component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive with breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: < 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

The sidebar converts to a mobile drawer on smaller screens.

### CRUD Operations
All CRUD operations automatically update the data and trigger success notifications:

```javascript
// Example: Adding a member
const handleAddMember = (memberData) => {
  addMember(memberData);
  // Automatically shows success notification
  // Updates the members list
  // Closes the modal
};
```

### Notifications
Toast notifications appear for all user actions:
- Success (green)
- Error (red)
- Warning (yellow)
- Info (blue)

### Search & Filter
Members and payments pages include:
- Real-time search
- Status filtering
- Pagination for large datasets
